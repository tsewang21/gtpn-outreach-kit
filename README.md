## Usage

### Demo Accounts
You can test the application using these pre-configured accounts:

- **Super Admin**: `admin@yourorg.org` / `password`
- **Campaign Manager**: `manager@yourorg.org` / `password`

### Creating a New Account

1. Navigate to the login page

## Data Storage

Currently, the application uses local storage for user data. For production use, you should:

1. Replace the local storage system with a proper database (PostgreSQL, MySQL, etc.)
