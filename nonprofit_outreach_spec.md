## Project Overview: Nonprofit Outreach Kit (GTPN Edition)

### Core Purpose
This project is a multi-user web platform that helps GTPN (Global Tibetan Professionals Network) and similar nonprofit organizations run effective outreach campaigns via personalized email and multi-touch engagement flows. It extends a general "CSV URL Matcher" system into a powerful outreach and engagement engine tailored for nonprofit use cases.

### How It Serves GTPN Specifically

#### 1. **Email Campaigns for Outreach & Engagement**
- **Donation Appeals**: Generate email sequences asking for financial contributions to support GTPN's mission, events, and programs.
- **Petition Requests**: Although GTPN may not currently run petitions, this feature will allow the organization (and other nonprofits) to drive petition-based campaigns if needed.
- **Event Promotion**: Create outreach flows for Happy Hours, Hackathons, Mentorship Mixers, and other GTPN-led gatherings.

#### 2. **Mentorship Program Involvement**
- Generate emails asking professionals if they’re willing to:
  - Serve as mentors to younger Tibetan high school or college students
  - Provide career guidance, resume feedback, or networking support
  - Join virtual sessions or events geared toward mentorship

#### 3. **Private GTPN Directory Opt-In**
- Send personalized emails asking if individuals are comfortable having their:
  - **Name**
  - **Email address**
  - **LinkedIn/profile URL**
  listed in a **private, member-only GTPN database** that students and junior professionals can use to reach out for mentorship or guidance.
- The app will track and log their consent.

#### 4. **Outreach Coordination**
- GTPN can assign outreach reps (board members, volunteers) to each campaign.
- Built-in reminders and task trackers help ensure timely follow-ups.
- Centralized knowledge base will store:
  - GTPN’s mission language
  - Impact statements
  - Example outreach emails for different goals (mentorship, donations, etc.)

### GTPN-Specific Examples

- **Email Type 1**: "Support Tibetan Professional Growth – Donate Today"
- **Email Type 2**: "Join Us at the NYC Tibetan Professionals Happy Hour!"
- **Email Type 3**: "Would You Be Willing to Mentor a Tibetan Student This Fall?"
- **Email Type 4**: "Help GTPN Build a Stronger Directory – Can We Include You?"

These emails can be stored as templates, customized with personalization tokens (e.g. {FIRST_NAME}, {CITY}, {EVENT_NAME}), and deployed through automated sequences.

### Final Objective
The platform should help GTPN:
- Engage its extended network more consistently and professionally
- Simplify email outreach and reduce manual work
- Encourage mentorship, event attendance, and donations
- Build a sustainable system of professional support across the Tibetan diaspora

This tool will start with GTPN in mind but remain flexible enough to serve other nonprofits with similar needs.
